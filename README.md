#Overview

A brief overview of the opportunity and need for the "github for food recipes" idea. Be the "github" for food recipes. Allow users to find the core base of any given recipe and trace the differences in ingredient clusters/amounts. Users are able to try or create "branches" of a recipe to share.

## What problem does this solve? (Value Prop)
* Cooks want to be able to get ideas of how they can tweak an existing recipe. What are easy substitutes (given constraints due to dietary, seasonal food, or even what's in the fridge)?
* Cooks want to be able to record different experiments to see if it worked. Where can I save different experiments to access in the future?
* Cooks want some validation when it comes to a new dish. There isn't just one recipe for a dish, there are thousands. How does one compare one receipe from another? 

## For whom do we solve that problem (Target User)
* Amateur Cook: Help them get started on a recipe that is crowdsourced. Help 
* Professional Chef: Help them find innovative/long forgotten ingredient combinations

## What are the alternatives? (Competition)
Trusted Advisor: Go to a select few trusted sources (foodnetwork.com for the base recipe)
Analog: Collect recipe, print on an index card, and give it a whirl
Formal: Cook book


## Why are we suited (Differentiator)
Crowdsourced popularity and variation:
* Collect and analyze a bunch of recipes to find the tried-and-true steps for a dish
* Ability for users to strengthen an existing branch or graft a new branch onto a recipe

## Deployment Strategy
Mining all recipes will be extremely difficult. Instead, narrow scope of the project. Initial deployment can be around a protein (chicken-only), style (roasted chicken-only), or a dish (chicken kiev).

~~## Preliminay Estimated Cost~~
NA

## Factors critical to sucess? (solution requirements)
Visualization does not get in the way of the core value proposition-providing a recipe
Needs to show traffic/activity when it comes to the less traveled branches


#### Ted's Notes
* Future possibilities: (just to keep track of ideas)
  * We could possibly provide ways to have users buy ingredients directly from stores, local farms, etc. if interested or hard to find.
  * Provide ability to see history of recipes (maybe add comparison feature to compare variations so can mix and match recipes easier visually?)
